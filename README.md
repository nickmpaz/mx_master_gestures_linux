# MX Master Gesture Controls For Ubuntu

## About

Logitech does not support gesture controls for the MX Master on Ubuntu. 
This is a hacky implementation of those gesture controls. It uses 
a keyboard shortcut for the MX Master thumb button to run a script. The
script listens for mouse movements and acts accordingly.

## Setup

Create a keyboard shortcut for Ctrl + Alt + Tab that runs this script.

## Controls

- Up - Move up a workspace
- Down - Move down a workspace
- Left - Send window left a screen
- Right - Send window right a screen
